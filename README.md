# Typer Shark Clone

Welcome to the Typer Shark Clone, a typing clone game designed to sharpen your typing skills while having fun!

## Overview

Typer Shark Clone is a simple typing game designed from the features of the original Typer Shark Game where words (represented as different types of sharks) glide across the screen, and you must type them correctly and quickly to "eliminate" them before they reach you. The game combines fast-paced gameplay with a clean interface and smooth animations, making it both challenging and visually pleasing.

This project is intended for the developer to polish python programming skills during the development
